# leetCodemay20Challenge
In this repository I have Added all the  Solutions of May-20 Leet Code Challenge.

1. Badversion Problem Uses Binary Search.for solving the  Problem.
2. Solutions.java  == This i solved in O(n2) time complextiy by comparing two arrays.
4. In this COmplement Problem First we need to convert the number into binary format then 1's complement then again into decimal format value.
5. In this Problem i have used linked Hash Map Because it maintains the insertion Order. And then just iterating map i got the first unique character.
6. In this we have to find majority element of array so i just used a map and stored key value pair and then just compare at the time of iterating map.
7. Cousin Node Of a tree == This problem can be solved by preorder traversal of the tree and then just check the depth and parent of the tree according to condition.
8. Straight Line Problem we can check by Just Using Coordinate Formula.
The point is if we take points p1(x, y), p2(x1, y1), p3(x3, y3), slopes of any two pairs is same then p1, p2, p3 lies on same line.
slope from p1 and p2 is y - y1 / x - x1
slope from p2 and p3 is y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
if these two slopes equal, then p1, p2, p3 lies on same line.
