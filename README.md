# leetCodemay20Challenge
In this repository I have Added all the  Solutions of May-20 Leet Code Challenge.

1. Badversion Problem Uses Binary Search.for solving the  Problem.
2. Solutions.java  == This i solved in O(n2) time complextiy by comparing two arrays.
4. In this COmplement Problem First we need to convert the number into binary format then 1's complement then again into decimal format value.
5. In this Problem i have used linked Hash Map Because it maintains the insertion Order. And then just iterating map i got the first unique character.
6. In this we have to find majority element of array so i just used a map and stored key value pair and then just compare at the time of iterating map.
